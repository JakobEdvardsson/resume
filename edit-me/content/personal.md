I'm a Computer Science student at Malmö University with a passion for software development.
When I'm not coding, I’m cosplaying as a sysadmin in my homelab, experimenting with different technologies and setups.
Currently working towards a Bachelor's in Computer Science with a focus on Computer Systems Development.
